# Belvedere Challenge

The Belvedere Challenge is an informal race celebrating the public lanes (aka "secret stairways") of Belvedere, California. The race route has been designed to traverse every single publicly-accessible lane in Belvedere.

The second annual race will take place in February 2024. Please check back here for more information as the date approaches. Thanks! For now, please enjoy last year's handdrawn logo for the inaugural BC:
