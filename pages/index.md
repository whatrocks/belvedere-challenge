# Belvedere Challenge

The Belvedere Challenge is an informal race celebrating the public lanes (aka "secret stairways") of Belvedere, California. The race route has been designed to traverse every single publicly-accessible lane in Belvedere.

The second annual race will take place in February 2024. As ever, the entry fee will include a $2 bill. Please check back here for more information as the date approaches. You can also add your email here and you'll be contacted early next year about registering for the race.
